#STEM (SpatioTemporal Exploratory Model)

##Overview
The STEM is an ensemble of locally defined, randomly located, spatially overalpping decision trees and generates a final prediction by aggregating over all overlapping pixels with either the mean, mode, or weighted mean. These scripts offer a Python implementation of the STEM algorithm developed by Fink and others (2010)
